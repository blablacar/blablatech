description:    The story of the Coding Night #2 at BlaBlaCar.
---

In Jan 2015 we organised the [first Coding Night](http://blablatech.com/blog/coding-night-in-blablacar/) in BlaBlaCar, an internal Fun&Serious hackaton. It was a massive success. Remember? That's were [Ride Map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF6U6DZgMLk) (formerly known as Meet your Co-rider) was born, this amazing feature that enable drivers and passengers sharing a ride together to meet more easily at departure point. Then we decided to run a second edition. 

It took place on Thursday 24th and Friday 25th of September at BlaBlaCar offices in Paris.

</p>

The entire and brand new Polish tech team joined the event in Paris, as well as our Roumanian tech team, our product managers, UX/UI designers and some lonely souls from our Communications team who wanted to join and geek out a bit :)

The concept was simple: create new projects, build something from the very begining, code all night and be together during 24 hours. There were no specific rule and projects could be about BlaBlaCar or not, crazy, serious, useless, for team mates or members, feasible in 24 hours or in 10 years with all of NASA involved. 

## Let's dive into these 24 crazy hours

Alain was ready to fight...against tiredness.

</p>

To start, every participant who had an idea presented it along with his "recruitment" needs to bring his project to life. We had 47 pitches. 20 teams were created (twice as much as the first Coding Night, which is normal since our tech team doubled \o/).
Once everyone found his team and grabbed his special Coding Night T-Shirt, the real game could start!!

After a first stop around 7pm for a couple of [beers](http://blablatech.com/blog/think-it-brew-it-drink-it/) together, a bunch of pizzas and loads of sushis, the first part of the night was easy.

At 4 am, we were still numerous and awaken

2nd part of the night was somewhat less efficient :)

    </tr>
 </table>

And suddenly some of us felt asleep...with different techniques

We still had a lot of time left before the demo. Fortunately, BlaBlaCar is a resourceful company, and we had several yoga and sophrology workshops on the rooftop at sunrise to help us deal with physical and mental fatigue.

It was amazing and really helped us! Thanks a lot to Anne-Laure Paccoud and Marie Lefevre.

The event finally ended with 20 incredible demos and a ton of applause on friday at 2pm. This was a very special moment I will remember for a long time, we were all tired but very excited to discover the projects. We streamed it live for the whole company.
