## Here we go!

In January, BlaBlaCar hosted its first internal coding event ever... 24 hours of non-stop coding, whatever the project, whatever the technology. **Just code** from Friday 2pm to Saturday 2pm. It was amazing to see how highly involved were all those teams to transform their great ideas into working projects.

## Why?

The idea of running a coding event has been around for quite a while, but only in late November we comitted on doing the first (thanks to the engineers, who pushed towards this).

The concept was based on 4 main ideas:

* **Give priority to unlimited creativity**: everybody had about a week to propose a project of any kind
* **Mix teams**: everybody can choose with whom to work with from whatever team...
* **Create ownership**, thus allowing people to "think it, build it" and make it available for "use it"...
* **Have fun!**

## How?

The show started with a 2 min pitch of each of the 25 proposed projects (no imposed link to BlaBlaCar).
Then 11 teams formed freely (even single-person teams were allowed) and the hacking could start.
Following 24 hours of coding, the remaining teams had to present their work.

## 24 loooooooooooong hours of coding...

## Time to sleep?

Staying up all night long is a challenge by itself:

After effort comes comfort! The breakfast was the perfect moment to have a break, to exchange on the different projects' progress and to recharge the batteries.

## And the winner is...

3... 2... 1... time is over! We all met once again, exhausted but curious about the outcome of the projects. 8 teams presented their projects (meaning that we lost only three during the night).

And here’s the TOP3, selected by all remaining participants on Saturday afternoon:

### 3rd place: TOTOR

*by Mathieu Louafi*

A tool to suggest smart stop-overs for a BlaBlaCar trip.

## Conclusion

This event was a big success in terms of team spirit, awesome ideas and energy level. This coding night was also a test run for an all-BlaBlaCar Hackathon, that eventually might come in 2015!

And last but not least, we're [hiring](http://www.blablacar.com/blog/recruitment) !
